Chef-Interpreter
================

This project was created for a language semantics course. The interpreter interprets Chef programs, based on the language description by David Morgan at http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/chef.html

The syntax is nearly identical to what David proposed - we had to make design choises in some edge cases, which I might list here when I find the time.
